# Trait-based Rewiring Algorithm & Analysis Outline

The purposes of this document are to:
1. Outline the general purposes of this project
2. Describe the components of the analysis broadly, and
3. Specifically outline the various programs that will jointly perform the analysis
4. Act as a reference for anyone trying to implement this analysis in a different language/framework

## Project Overview

## Analysis Components

### Network Construction

#### Define network shape and # of spp

#### Assign trait values to each sp

#### Populate interaction matrix

### Biomass Model Formulation

#### Functions to define biomass model for each sp

#### Draw initial biomass values for each sp

#### Simulate network dynamics out to a stable point

####  

### Instigation of Rewiring

### Tracking Biomass Outputs Through Rewiring

## Pseudocode
